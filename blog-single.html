									<div class="news-text">
										<p>I wanted to share what I learned about the Mansaka people. It's actually pretty interesting - their name "Mansaka" means "people of the clearings" (from the word saka, which is about farming fields). I found out that some Visayan people who came to Mindanao in the 1950s and 60s got this wrong - they thought it meant "people who go up" since saka means "to go up" in their language [1].
											Fun fact: before they were called Mansaka, they were known as Manlorowa, which meant "people who live in the forest." I read in my research [1] that they probably ended up in the forests because they were running from these raiders called Kalagan Moros.
											Most Mansaka people live in three provinces in the Davao Region - Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, and Compostela Valley. You can find them in places like Tagum, Nabunturan, Mawab, Maco, and Pantukan. According to some statistics I found [1],Compostela Valley had the most Mansaka people - like 32,052 of them in 2000! That's about 5% of everyone living there. Apparently, Pantukan is where they originally came from before spreading to other areas. Oh, and I found this recent study by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies that says there are now around 56,507 Mansaka people!
											When it comes to their language, it's part of this bigger group called the Manuvu linguistic group. This includes different dialects spoken by the Tagakaolo people in Davao del Sur, the Davaoeño in Davao City, the Mansaka and Mandaya in Davao del Norte, and the Isamal in Samal Island. I thought it was cool to learn that their language is super similar to Mandaya - like 90% similar according to this website [1].											
										</p>
										<p>So I did more research and found out some super interesting stuff about the Mansaka's history! Apparently, their ancestry is like a mix of different peoples - Indonesians, Malays, and even Chinese people who came at different times. Pretty cool how they developed over thousands of years!
											The Mansaka are actually related to another group called the Mandaya - they're like cousins who just speak a bit differently. They were known to be warriors but they had some tough times too. These people called the Kalagan Moros would often attack them, which forced them to hide in the mountains. There are these interesting stories about why they went up there - some say they didn't want to be circumcised, while others say they just really loved eating pork and didn't want to give it up!
											Things got really rough for them when people from the Visayas started moving to their land in the 1900s. The settlers kind of tricked them - they'd trade small stuff like wine and tobacco for huge pieces of land. 😕 Later, during President Marcos's time, big companies started logging and mining in their areas, which totally messed up their environment.
											Today, the Mansaka are dealing with some serious problems. They've lost a lot of their traditional culture because they kept having to move around, and now they're struggling with things like poverty and not having enough schools or healthcare. The mining companies are still causing trouble by polluting their water, which is making people sick. It's pretty sad that they've lost connection to a lot of their ancestral lands where they used to worship.

										</div>
										<p>Now let me tell you about how the Mansaka make a living - it's actually super fascinating! Their main jobs are farming, hunting, and fishing, but they do it in such a cool way.
											When they farm, they grow stuff like rice (they call it humay), corn (batad), sweet potatoes, and even coffee. But here's what I found really interesting - they don't just plant whenever they feel like it. They actually follow what they call an "ecological calendar" where they watch the moon, stars, and even their cats! 😺 No joke - they look at their cats' eyes to tell if it's high tide or low tide (when the pupils are big = high tide). How creative is that?
											For fishing, they've come up with some pretty clever methods. They use things like naturally hooked rattan shoots and even make bamboo fences across streams to catch fish. And for hunting, they use these cool tools like blowguns and special traps. They even have trained hunting dogs called tumawan - like their own K-9 unit!
											When it comes to food, OMG, they can make like 19 different dishes from their harvest! They cook stuff in bamboo tubes and wrap food in leaves - kind of like their own version of sustainable packaging. One dish that sounds interesting is called liorot, which is pork cooked in bamboo tubes with special leaves.
											But sadly, things aren't as great nowadays. 😕 Big logging companies and mining operations are really messing up their forests, making it harder for them to hunt and farm like they used to. The soil isn't as good anymore because of pollution and erosion. A lot of younger Mansaka are starting to work in cities now, though some are choosing careers that could help their community, like becoming doctors or teachers, which I think is really awesome!
											Some good news though - they're adapting by planting permanent crops like durian and rambutan trees. These are smart choices because even if they have to leave their farms temporarily (like during conflicts), the trees will still be there when they come back!

											Next up, I learned about how the Mansaka govern themselves, and it's pretty different from what we're used to!
											So traditionally, they have these unwritten laws that come from their customs and beliefs. They have three really important leaders: first, there's the matadong (or matikadong) who's like this super wise elder that everyone respects. Then there's the bagani, who's basically their warrior leader (how cool is that?), and finally the balian, who's usually a woman and handles all their religious ceremonies.
											The matadong is like their version of a supreme court justice + community leader rolled into one! 😮 They're so respected that in some places, kids aren't even allowed to say their names! And get this - their whole family is considered "royal-blooded" just because they're related to the matadong. But with great power comes great responsibility (yeah, I just quoted Spider-Man 😅) - they have to be super hardworking, helpful, and protect their community from bad people.
											Now, here's something intense - they had this thing called a bagani system. To become a bagani (warrior), you had to... um... let's just say prove yourself in battle for noble causes. They'd have this special ceremony where they'd get to wear this cool headdress called a marogang. Pretty intense stuff!
											The balian is super interesting too! She's like their spiritual doctor who can talk to divine beings and heal people. She works with spirit guides called abyan and goes into these trances while doing healing rituals. You can't just decide to become a balian though - you have to be chosen by spirits through dreams or learn it from your parents who are also balian.
											But things are different now. In the 1920s, when the Americans came, they changed their traditional system and introduced the barrio lieutenant position. Today, they follow our regular government system with barangay chairmen and stuff. There's this law called the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act that's supposed to protect their right to choose their own leaders, but sadly, sometimes politicians and mining companies try to manipulate this system. 😕

										<p>You won't believe how interesting the Mansaka's social life is! Let me tell you what I learned about their family system and traditions.
											First off, they have specific names for EVERYONE in the family. Like, they don't just say "cousin" - they have different words for all kinds of relatives. For example, barai means "your child's spouse's siblings and parents" (try saying that five times fast! 😅). They even have special words for great-great-grandparents (ompotaringa) - how cool is that?
											Here's something that blew my mind - their traditional marriage customs! It's called buya, and it's basically arranged marriage but make it fancy. The guy's family has to give this thing called gaos (dowry) to the girl's family. And if the girl's dad was a bagani (remember those warrior leaders I mentioned earlier?), they had to pay the highest dowry - we're talking multiple slaves, brass boxes, and these special brass instruments called agong. Sometimes, the guy even had to work for the girl's family before they could get married!
											And get this - their wedding celebrations could last FOUR DAYS! Or until they ran out of food, whichever came first, lol.
											When it comes to friendship (they call it idarog or idawat), they have this super meaningful way of fixing broken relationships called kadayaw. They don't just say "sorry" and move on - they have this whole ceremony where they share food, give gifts, and even dance to show that everything's cool now. There's another version where they cut a piece of rattan to symbolize cutting off the bad vibes and starting fresh. How symbolic is that?
											Some of their other traditions are pretty unique too. Like, for burial rituals, they put the body in a hollowed-out log instead of a regular coffin. And if they keep the body in the house, the whole family has to move out for YEARS until... well, you know. 😬
											They're also really into herbal medicine! They've got natural remedies for everything - headaches, stomach problems, even malaria! A lot of these actually work too, which is pretty amazing.
											But things are changing now. The younger Mansaka (like my age) are getting more into formal education. The older folks are cool with it because they know education = better jobs, but they're also like "don't forget our traditions!" Which honestly makes total sense - it's important to move forward but also remember where you came from, right?
										</p>
										<p>Now I want to share something really fascinating about the Mansaka's spiritual beliefs!
											They believe in a supreme God called Magbabaya, who they say created everything on Earth. But they also have these cool things called manaog - these are like domestic gods represented by wooden statues. Fun fact: you can actually tell if a manaog is male or female by looking at how it's carved! 🗿
											They have this special person called a balian (remember the spiritual healer I mentioned earlier?) who does these interesting rituals. They set up this platform called a siklat that either hangs from the ceiling or sits on poles like a teepee. The balian keeps their manaog statues near the kitchen ceiling, where they eventually turn black from all the cooking smoke - kind of like how old family photos get that vintage look!
											The Mansaka have some really interesting beliefs about health and healing. Like, if someone gets sick, they believe it might be caused by supernatural beings (kind of like how we blame germs, but their version is way more mystical!). They have different healing rituals:											
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>• In one called pangapog, they offer betel-nut to Magbabaya.</li>
											<li>• In another called panawagtawag, they use a white chicken, eggs, and other stuff as offerings, and they transfer the sickness into a wooden figure (almost like a spiritual version of a vaccine!).</li>
										</ul>
										<p></p>
										<p>Even farming and hunting have spiritual aspects! Before they hunt or farm, they say special prayers (pangantad) to ask for blessings. They also believe in omens - like if you dream about getting betel nut the night before a hunt, it means you're gonna catch something good! 🍀
											But here's where things get kind of sad. A lot of Mansaka have become Christians now (like 95% were Catholic by 1973!), which isn't bad by itself, but some churches have told them their traditional beliefs are evil or shameful. 😕 Many balian have stopped their practices because they're told it's "devil's work." Some Mansaka even feel like they have to completely give up their cultural identity to be Christian.

										<p>Early Mansaka houses were built on treetops or bamboo groves for defense against surprise attacks and raids. These houses were connected by bamboo bridges to facilitate inter-household assistance. The bagani's house had an upper balcony that doubled as a watchtower.
											Today, the most common Mansaka dwelling is a one-room house raised above the ground on four poles, with walls made of chopped bamboo tubes and a roof of wooden tiles. The flooring is constructed from bai, and the ladder is made of a terraced trunk. A less common dwelling is a four-room house resting on ten or more posts.
											Despite modern influences, the Mansaka continue to uphold their traditional housing practices, adapting them to contemporary needs while preserving their cultural heritage.

										<p>They traditionally created dagmay (abaca cloth) through a labor-intensive process using abaca fibers dyed with natural plant extracts. These fibers are woven into intricate designs, often with cultural significance, such as laron na opat (crocodiles).
											Mansaka women's attire includes the dagum blouse, paired with different types of skirts, either crafted by the Mansaka or obtained from the Visayans. Men traditionally wore embroidered shirts, short pants, and sarakob hats. Both men and women accessorize with various jewelry and adornments, such as belts, earplugs, and necklaces, which often have cultural significance.
											Over time, the influence of Visayan clothing styles became more prominent, especially among the men. The practice of blackening teeth, once a cultural hallmark, has largely been abandoned by the younger generation, who now dress similarly to the Visayan lowlanders.
										</p>
										<p>The Mansaka people are known for their rich cultural heritage, particularly in the areas of weaponry, art, and craftsmanship. Traditionally, they were skilled warriors, utilizing spears like the piaransan and budjak, often accompanied by wooden shields called karasag. 
											Their artistic prowess is evident in their intricate wood carvings, most notably the manaog statues, which depict both male and female figures with unique characteristics. Weaving is another significant aspect of their culture, with finely woven baskets and intricately decorated bolo scabbards being renowned. 
											Furthermore, the Mansaka are skilled craftsmen who create various functional objects such as brass boxes, clay pots, and a wide array of baskets for everyday use. Their ingenuity extends to everyday items like lamps, which they fashion using dried lauan sap and abaca leaves. The manaog statues also provide intriguing insights into their possible past practices, including secondary burial rituals.
										</p>
										<p>They also possess a rich musical tradition, with a diverse array of instruments that play a vital role in their social and cultural life. 1 Percussion instruments like the agong and tarabon, used for signaling and ceremonial purposes, are prominent. 2 String instruments include the kudlong, a two-stringed guitar with variations like the binudyaan and binarig, and the takol, a four-stringed bamboo instrument. The kubing, a mouth harp carved from bamboo, produces soft melodies. Wind instruments like the parundag and bamboo flutes add to the musical landscape. 3 The kulintang, a gong ensemble, is a significant instrument with Muslim influences. The gimbal, a drum made with carefully aged animal hide, is central to the lisag, a unique instrumental performance. The koratong, a slit drum, serves a practical purpose, summoning neighbors. This diverse range of instruments reflects the vibrant and multifaceted musical heritage of the Mansaka people.	
										</p>
										<p>The Mansaka people have a rich tradition of dance, a vital part of their cultural expression. Their dances are characterized by intricate movements of the hands, arms, feet, and knees, often reflecting ancient rituals and beliefs.
											The anito balian, a healing ritual dance, is a significant example. Involving a medicine man and a female medium, it incorporates elements like chicken sacrifice and the use of a human skull. The japa kaunod is a courtship dance, with the boy gracefully circling the girl. Other notable dances include the inamo na sa yaw (monkey dance), the udol (a dance honoring fallen warriors), the sinakaysakay (a slow, graceful dance for women), the tinampa (a more energetic dance for men), the balian's basal (a sacred dance performed during rituals), and the sarub or sarud, a war dance performed by warriors with spears.											
											These dances, while some may have lost their original ritualistic significance, continue to be performed for entertainment and cultural preservation, offering a glimpse into the vibrant and multifaceted cultural heritage of the Mansaka people.

										<blockquote class="overlay">
											<p>The Mansaka people possess a rich and complex cultural tapestry woven from threads of history, tradition, and resilience. Despite facing numerous challenges, including historical displacement, environmental degradation, and the pressures of modernization, the Mansaka continue to strive to preserve their unique identity.
